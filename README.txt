Topographic network analysis for QGIS
=====================================

Terrain can be represented as a collection of objects - terrain features such as valleys, ridges, hills etc. One possible approach to arrive at such a model is modelling relationships between elements in a terrain model, most commonly pixels in an elevation model. Here, pixels are connected according to their height difference. Such a network, in it's simplest form identical to the one used for watershed modelling, can then be analysed for further proscessing...
